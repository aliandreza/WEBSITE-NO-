                 <ol>
                     <li>1, Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) 
                         are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old 
                         World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015.[1]
                         These species come in a range of colors, and many species
                         have the ability to change color.<il>
                     <li>2, Most chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap
                         around tree branches. Their hands and feet have large toes that
                         help them cling to branches. Besides changing skin color,
                         chameleons have another feature that no other animals have.</il>
                     <li>3, Chameleons are solitary animals. Forced handling or unwanted 
                         handling can cause hissing and biting. A chameleons bite is painful,
                         however, not toxic or harmful to humans. Handling can cause chameleons
                         to have chronic low-level stress, which leads to poor health.</il>

             <p><i>Interseting facts about </i></p>
               <ol>
                   <il>1, Cicadas, for many, represent personal change, renewal,
                        rebirth, and transformation. ... A lot of people use cicadas 
                        to symbolize their own personal transformation, in art, song, 
                        poetry, or even a tattoo. The cicada inherently symbolizes what they 
                        were (nymph) and all the glory of what they have become (adult form)</il>
                   <il>2, The cicadas are not harmful to humans and do not pose a danger to plants 
                       through feeding. The cicadas, however, can cause damage to plants 
                       throughheir egg-laying habits</il>
                   <il>3, Cicadas are mostly beneficial. They prune mature trees, aerate the soil,
                        and once they die, their bodies serve as an important source of nitrogen 
                        for growing trees. When cicadas come out, they're eaten 
                        by just about anything with an insectivorous diet</il>
